Hello {!Lead.FirstName}, 


My name is Andrew Upchurch and I work at the Global Association of Risk Professionals. As an FRM holder, you know us well and we appreciate your continued support.

Recently we have been working with {!Lead.Company_Short_Name__c}, helping them build their corporate risk education profile. We have been in contact with your CRO, Gary Mandelblatt, and he is very interested in the FRM and our corporate initiatives. 

When we mentioned that we have over 90 FRM holders working in {!Lead.Company_Short_Name__c} and its subsidiaries, Gary was thrilled and asked if we could provide the names of these FRM professionals. Because of the confidentiality agreement, we would like to ask your permission if we could pass your name, department and title along to Mr. Mandelblatt. Please let me know if this would be permissible.

If you have any questions, feel free to follow up with me and I can clarify.

Thank you for your time,


Andrew J. Upchurch
